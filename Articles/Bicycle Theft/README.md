# Bicycle theft in the West Midlands

### Revealed: West Midlands police struggle to identify bike thieves 

By George Willoughby | Wednesday 23 September 2020 |

Only one in 10 cases of bike theft end with a suspect being identified. 

New figures show the West Midlands police force is struggling to finish investigations with a confirmed offender.

Sprocket Cycles is a local bike shop in Birmingham. The owner described the situation as an issue that has been a real problem for "3 or 4 years, possibly longer."

"We get a lot of people in here who do get their bicycles stolen. They are always looking for replacements because they don't want it to happen again.
Make sure you get a very good lock and get some insurance. 

"When you are buying a lock, you are investing in time. The better the lock, the longer it will take so it will give you a chance."

There were 176 cases of bike theft in July, with 159 investigations concluding without an identifiable suspect.

On average, 33% of crimes concluded without an identifiable suspect.

The West Midlands Police could not comment on the figures due to not having the capacity to fulfil student requests.
